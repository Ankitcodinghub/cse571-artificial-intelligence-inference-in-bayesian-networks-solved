<h1>&nbsp;Purpose</h1>
Apply inference to Bayesian Networks to reason about uncertainty. This technique is useful for&nbsp; real-world problems that can be modeled as an inference problems, such as for determining an&nbsp; insurance premium.

<h1>&nbsp;Objectives</h1>
Learners will be able to:

<ul>
<li>Familiarize with the representation of Bayesian Networks.</li>
<li>Apply inference techniques to Bayesian Network to reason about uncertainty.</li>
<li>Solve complex inference problems with Bayesian Network.</li>
</ul>
<strong>&nbsp;Technology Requirements</strong>

<h1>&nbsp;Assignment Description and Directions</h1>
It is in a parallel universe, the Good and the Evil are fighting for the earth. If the Good win, people are&nbsp; more likely to live a better life, but Evil can also make peopleâ€™s life better (for their evil purpose).&nbsp; Knowing the probability, the analysts on the parallel universe model the situation with the Bayes&nbsp; Network as shown below:

<h2>&nbsp;Part 1</h2>
<em>&nbsp;You will be calculating and typing in your numeric results to a specific place value. Refer to the&nbsp; assignment submission area in the course to input and submit your answers. </em>

<h3>&nbsp;Figure 3.0: Bayesian Network</h3>
It is in a parallel universe, the Good and the Evil is fighting for the earth. If the Good win, people&nbsp; are more likely to live a better life, but Evil will also try to make peopleâ€™s life better (for their evil&nbsp; purpose). Knowing the probability, the analysts on the parallel universe model the situation in&nbsp; Figure 3.0: Bayesian Network.

<h3>&nbsp;Figure 3.1: Joint Probability Table</h3>
Review Figure 3.0: Bayesian Network and Figure 3.1: Joint Probability Table. What is the joint&nbsp; probability for 1.a, 1.b, 1.c, and 1.d?

<h2>&nbsp;Part 2</h2>
<em>&nbsp;You will be calculating and typing in your numeric results to a specific place value. Refer to the&nbsp; assignment submission area in the course to input and submit your answers. </em>

The winner of the fight claims that they are the Good, but we cannot be sure. What is the conditional&nbsp; probability P(+g|+b) that the Good won the fight knowing that peopleâ€™s life is getting better?

<h2>&nbsp;Part 3</h2>
<em>&nbsp;You will be calculating and typing in your numeric results to a specific place value. Refer to the&nbsp; assignment submission area in the course to input and submit your answers. </em>

<h3>&nbsp;Figure 3.2</h3>
Review Figure 3.2. Now, assume we have observed more evidence, therefore we can make better&nbsp; inferences. The analysts on the parallel universe introduced two new random variables:

<ol>
<li>Whether there are more kind people (K).</li>
<li>Whether there are more greedy people (Y).</li>
</ol>
<strong>&nbsp;Table 3.3 </strong>

Review Table 3.3, which shows the full joint distribution. What are the values of 3.a â€“ 3.o?

<h2>&nbsp;Part 4</h2>
<em>&nbsp;You will be calculating and typing in your numeric results to a specific place value. Refer to the&nbsp; assignment submission area in the course to input and submit your answers. </em>

4.a Using either full joint distribution or conditional tables, what is the probability of P(+y|+g)?&nbsp; 4.b Using either full joint distribution or conditional tables, what is the probability of&nbsp; P(+y|+b,+g)?

4.c Using either full joint distribution or conditional tables, what is the probability of P(+y)?

4.d Using either full joint distribution or conditional tables, what is the probability of P(+k |+y)?

<h1>&nbsp;Submission Directions for Assignment Deliverables</h1>
Refer to the assignment submission space in the course to type and submit your answers. You will&nbsp; have one attempt to submit your answers. This assignment is auto-graded and feedback is provided.

This assignment submission is set as a Quiz type to enable auto-grading, with a duration of the quiz&nbsp; set as 3 hours. Since you would already know the questions from the PDF document, start the&nbsp; quiz/assignment only after you have completed it and are ready with the answers. Since the&nbsp; assignment is auto-graded and feedback is provided, strictly only one submission is allowed.&nbsp; Re-submission will not be allowed for any reason including errors that mistakenly occurred while&nbsp; entering the answers.
